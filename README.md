Screen Capture for Chrome and Firefox
### For Google Chrome ###
1. You must access **chrome://extensions**, enable the **Developer Mode** then click on **Load Unpacked Extension** and select the folder **screen-capture-chrome**.
2. After that you need to get the **ID** from your newly loaded extension and replace the variable **EXTENSION_ID** from the file **www/assets/js/index.js** on line **29** to your own EXTENSION_ID.

### For Firefox ###
* You don't have to change anything, however **it only works with HTTPS**.
* To test on localhost you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok").

#### Detail ####
On **screen-capture-chrome/manifest.json** you need to **change the second URI** (from the object **externally_connectable.matches**) to yours. The URI will be generated by **ngrok**. Follow the instructions on [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok.com").
