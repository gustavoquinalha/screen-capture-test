Screen Capture for Chrome and Firefox
## For Google Chrome ##
* You must access **chrome://extensions** and enable de **Developer Mode**, and then click on **Load Unpacked Extension** and select the folder **screen-capture-chrome**.
After that you need to get the **ID** from your newly loaded extension and replace the variable **EXTENSION_ID** from the file **www/assets/js/index.js** on line **29**.

## For Firefox ##
* You don't have to change anything, however **it only works with HTTPS**. To test on localhost you can use (https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok").
